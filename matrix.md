## What is Matrix ##

As the [Matrix.org](https://matrix.org/) Foundation put it on their website:
> Matrix is an open source project that publishes the Matrix open standard for secure, decentralised, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed reference implementations.
> 
> Maintained by the non-profit Matrix.org Foundation, we aim to create an open platform which is as independent, vibrant and evolving as the Web itself... but for communication.

## Why Matrix? ##

Matrix is neat! It's decentralized and secure. I like that I own the server my community lives on. No matter what happens to Discord or Twitch, I'll have my own little corner on Matrix.
